-   Didn't realise how long DNS propagation for a new domain can take. Anyways, figured it out eventually!

(I won't be posting the repository nor the link to the CTF website because of the private nature of the inside jokes used in the site. So just trust that it exists.)

---

### Day 91: August 2, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

-   Worked really hard on completing the website. Finished it by 7 in the morning!

**What I learned:**

-   Hacking together a CTF website with two friends in 36 hours :D

**Thoughts:**

-   In the end, this was very similar to a hackathon. We worked pretty much non stop, and finished the website in literally just 36 hours.
-   The website is a hack, sure, but I still am really proud of it :D
-   Thanks [Shivam](https://github.com/TREXXX27), [Piyush](https://www.instagram.com/the.lone_wolf_/), and [Ashish](https://github.com/AshishKnightfury)! If you're reading this, then you should check them out, for sure!

---

### Day 95: August 8, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:

-   Revised Leetcode [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
-   Revised Leetcode [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)
-   Revised Leetcode [Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)
-   Leetcode [Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)
-   Participated in [32<sup>nd</sup> LeetCode Biweekly Contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-32/). Was able to solve 3 out of 4 questions (yay!), and ranked 1309 out of 10463 participants.
-   Leetcode [1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-32/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/)
-   Leetcode [1540. Can Convert String in K Moves](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-32/problems/can-convert-string-in-k-moves/)

**What I learned:**

-   `SHIFT + ALT + DOWN ARROW` copies the current line to the next line in VSCode
-   RECALLED

```
make_heap(hp.begin(), hp.end()); //heapify a container
int a = hp.front(); pop_heap(hp.begin(), hp.end()); //pop from heap
hp.push_back(x); push_heap(hp.begin(), hp.end()); //push into heap
```

-   Priority Queues in C++ (`priority_queue<int> pq;`)
-   Prefix sums

**Thoughts:**

-   Leetcode Contigous Array was HARD. Took me a while to first learn about prefix sums and then understand all the concepts. Watching Errichto after learning prefix sums helped quite a lot.
-   Participated in a Leetcode contest after quite a while. And for the first time ever, was able to solve 75% (3 of 4) questions! Would have solved the last one too, were it not for the time :P
-   It was pretty great seeing that I was able to solve 3 questions (never was able to do it before). **Next goal:** all four of four questions!
-   I guess having someone to do all of this competitive programming stuff together with you is pretty great. We even discussed the questions and our approaches after the contest. How cool is that! (Talking about @TREXXX27)
-   Only 5 days left for my #100DaysofCode challenege. In a sense, I don't really want it to end, but we'll see. The countdown has begun, anyways.

-   Leetcode [1544. Make The String Great](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-201/problems/make-the-string-great/)
-   Leetcode [1545. Find Kth Bit in Nth Binary String](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-201/problems/find-kth-bit-in-nth-binary-string/)
-   Leetcode [1546. Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-201/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-subarrays-with-sum-equals-target/)
-   Read some Competitive Programmer's Handbook

**Thoughts:**

-   Leetcode 1546 was pretty interesting in the way prefix sums could be used.
-   Was absolutely tired yesterday. Wanted to participate in the Codeforces contest, but I ended up asleep quite a bit before that.

### Day 97: August 10, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

-   Leetcode [678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string/)
-   Read about Graphs in the CPHB.

**What I learned:**

-   Revised Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List)
-   Learnt about Edge List representation of graphs
-   Graph Traversal!
-   DFS and BFS in graphs
-   Checking if graph is connected
-   Finding distance between two nodes in a graph (not necessarily shortest path) (using BFS)
-   Checking if graph has cycles (using DFS/BFS)
-   Chacking if graph is bipartite
-   About bipartite graphs

**Thoughts:**

-   Reading about graphs clears up so many things I wanted to know!
-   Realised how similar DFS and BFS are for trees and graphs. Makes sense though. Trees are special cases of graphs, after all.
-   Only 3 more days to go!
